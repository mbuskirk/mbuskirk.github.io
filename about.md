I am a second year Chemistry student at California Polytechnic State University.

### More Information

I'm currently working on a computational project under [Dr. Ashley McDonald](https://armcdona.github.io) to find the transition state of a strained unimolecular organic reaction.

I don't have a lot of hobbies. I suppose I spend a lot of my time exploring classical music and otherwise wasting time on YouTube.
